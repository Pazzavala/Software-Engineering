3)	Initial Sprint Backlog:  On Wednesday, April 12th, during class, we will create your teamâ€™s Sprint Backlog using our Product Backlog we developed on Monday.  
We will use the same type of process as was shown in our video, the Sprint Planning Meeting.  We will break down the PBIs into tasks and determine how much work 
can be done in the allotted time for the Sprint.

ACTION REQUIRED:  You will put a clean copy of your Initial Sprint Backlog, named Initial_Sprint_Backlog.xxx  on GitHub by Friday, April 14th at 6:00 p.m.  
You should only have to clean up what we did during class and put your document(s) on GitHub. Type up your work and put on GitHub under the /sprint_backlogs directory.
Be very sure you understand what goes on the Sprint Backlog.  It is a separate document from the Product Backlog.  May I suggest a Xcel spreadsheet.  
Your PBIs must be fully defined on the document.  Do NOT just say PBI1 from the product backlog as a way to account for the PBI.  
Give the full user story for each PBI that is being worked on during the sprint.
